laszt-variant-filter
====================

A one class java 6 app that filters and compiles a particular set of files generated by SAMTools to identify variation in patient sample sequences when compared to the reference genome.

LASTZOVariantFilter.java compiles to two .class files.  To run the program from the command line, type:

> java LASTZVariantFilter filepath > filteredfilepath

or

> java LASTZVariantFilter directorypath > filteredfilepath

Help (an abbreviated version of this README) is provided with 

> java LASTZOutputSummariser --help
 
and when you provide no parameters at all
