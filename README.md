laszt-variant-filter
====================

A one class java 6 program that filters and compiles a particular set of files generated by SAMTools which identifies variation in patient sample sequences when compared to the reference genome.

LASTZOVariantFilter.java compiles to two .class files (you'll need to have the java6 sdk installed and run "javac LASTZVariantFilter).  To run the program from the command line, type:

> java LASTZVariantFilter filepath > filteredfilepath

or

> java LASTZVariantFilter directorypath > filteredfilepath

Help (an abbreviated version of this README) is provided with 

> java LASTZOutputSummariser --help
 
and when you provide no parameters at all
